### Guidelines for Abstracts
- Abstracts should be 250 words or less.
- Presentations will be selected for the symposium based on the relevancy of the research to a broad audience.
- Please submit an abstract that is understandable to the general research community.
- Avoid using highly technical language, abbreviations, and jargon specific to your field.
- Describe the objectives, results, and implications of your research in the abstract.
- Do not include illustrations with the abstract.
- Abstracts will not be edited for content. Double-check your abstract for typographical or grammatical errors before submitting it. Please avoid entering special characters and symbols.
- A Scientific Committee from UCR will review abstracts. We will do our best to accept as many abstracts as possible within the constraint of prioritizing representation across different disciplines.

### Guidelines for Oral Presentations
- Oral presentations are 15-minute Ted-Style presentations intended to promote interdisciplinary research and spark discussions among symposium participants. 
- These presentations are a way to present your current work to a general audience quickly. An essential benefit of giving a talk is the opportunity to get personalized, positive feedback as you meet people throughout the day and to find potential collaborators in other departments.
- Your talk should be understandable and exciting to the general academic audience.

### Guidelines for Poster Presentations
- Presenting a poster is a great way to exchange ideas and meaningful discussion.
- The poster session offers an opportunity to display materials and engage in open-ended, individualized, and informal discussions with interested parties.
- Prepare the poster for a general audience and posters will be judged according to clarity and interest.
